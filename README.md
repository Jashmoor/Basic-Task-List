# Basic-Task-List
A Basic Task List App, written in Vanilla.JS. SPA Version Included:

This little App will populate your localStorage with to-do items and display them to the screen,
you can click to remove items from the screen, and once all items have disappeared your
localStorage will be cleared 

(..of EVERYTHING!!... just a heads up if you are using it for something else...).


## Things I have learnt;

Basic localStorage CRUD Operations

JSON.parse and .stringify functions using Javascript objects

Object Indexing

Body = onLoad functions

A simple clock, with setInterval();

Creating Elements on the fly with Javascript

Managing Display data, with appendChild / removeChild loops
